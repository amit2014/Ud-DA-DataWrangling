# Ud-DataAnalyst-DataWrangling

## Project Overview
### Introduction
Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python, you will gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. This is called data wrangling. You will document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python and/or SQL.

The dataset that you'll be wrangling, analyzing, and visualizing is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs).

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. It was started in 2015 by college student Matt Nelson, and has received international media coverage. As of October 2017, it has over 3.7 million followers. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "[they're good dogs Brent](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/theyre-good-dogs-brent)."

WeRateDogs gave Udacity exclusive access to their tweet archive for you to wrangle, analyze, and visualize. This archive contains basic tweet data for all 5000+ of their tweets. More on this soon.

### What Software Do I Need?
You need to be able to work in a Jupyter Notebook on your computer. Revisit our Jupyter Notebook and Anaconda tutorials earlier in the Nanodegree program for installation instructions.

The following libraries (also known as packages) are required to complete this project:

* pandas
* numpy
* requests
* tweepy
* json

You can install these packages via conda or pip. Please revisit our Anaconda tutorial earlier in the Nanodegree program for package installation instructions.

You also need to be able to create written documents with images that can be exported as PDF files. Example: [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/), which is free.

A text editor, like [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (which is free), will be useful but is not required.
